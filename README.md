[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a0030ac5-3282-414c-9255-1a07ae5aa456/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/relaxed-newton-8b4a5e/deploys)

This is a landscape of the companies using Vue.js in Finland. This started as a project of [Vue.js Finland](https://www.meetup.com/vuejs-finland/) after realizing that most of the "Vue scene" is still unknown, and most people don't know who else is using Vue.js.

If your company is using Vue.js, please open a Pull Request to add yourselves to the list! This is a community made for the community.

The list is alphabetically sorted.
