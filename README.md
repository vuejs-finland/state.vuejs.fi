# State of Vue in Finland 🇫🇮

This is a landscape of the companies using Vue.js in Finland. This started as a project of [Vue.js Finland](https://www.meetup.com/vuejs-finland/) after realizing that most of the "Vue scene" is still unknown, and most people don't know who else is using Vue.js.

If your company is using Vue.js, please open a Pull Request to add yourselves to the list! This is community made for the community.

The list is alphabetically sorted.

| Company | Sponsor |
